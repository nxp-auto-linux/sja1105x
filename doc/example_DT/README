Ethernet phy node:
-----------------
The Ethernet Phy nodes need to have a label, so they can be referenced from the sja1105p node.
For example "phy0: ethernet-phy@8" (see doc/example_DT/ethernet_phys.dts): Phy at address 8 can be referenced by its label "phy0"


Properties of the sja1105p node:
------------------------------------

"compatible"
	-String that is matched against the of_device_id table "sja1105p_dt_ids" in sja1105p_init.c. Used to determine the switch type
"firmware_name"
	-(optional) Name of the firmware (in /lib/firmware) to be loaded for that switch
"spi-max-frequency"
	-the max SPI frequency
"spi-cpha"
	-SPI configuration to be used
"reg"
	-address of chip select



Properties of the port-X child node:
------------------------------------

"is-host"
	-Determines if the port is a host port or not
"null-phy"
	-Determines if the port has a phy connected to it or not
"phy-ref"
	-phandle to the connected ethernet phy
	-Must be 0x0 in case there is no phy connected to it (for example a host port or a cascaded port)
"logical-port-num"
	-logical port number, used for the port mapping
	-Must be 0xff in case the port is a cascaded port (see doc/example_DT/sja1105p_node.dts for an example)
